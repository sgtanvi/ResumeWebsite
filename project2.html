        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> Connect with others through the internet in a meditating way, to feel less alone in this digital space. 
        Inspired by the app Headspace, wellness, and connection from within and with others. 
        3d objects inspired by the Four Bodies by Jill Willard of our four distinct parts- physical, emotional, spiritual to 
        bring about a physical presence in our digital real and bring awareness to our bodies as we meditate in this space between 
        the screen and another across it.
