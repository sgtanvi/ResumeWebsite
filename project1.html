        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> The goal of Rush Hour Study app was to motivate students to do interval studying instead of cramming.
            My team and I were inspired by the Pomodoro technique (interval studying).
           We implemented an reward system as well to motivate students using with cute icons based on food
